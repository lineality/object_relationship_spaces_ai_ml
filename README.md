Object Relationship Spaces for AI ML: Proposal for an AI Operating System 
(a definable alternative to "general intelligence")

A definable way to describe the performance of AI, based on the relationships between types of "objects" that AI will need to deal with. 

Project-specific performance-skills-and-tests for AI are equal to points in a matrix of object-relationship(space)-vectors, which in future can be used with solutions found by AI.

The defined functions make possible an overall operating system to cover the all skills specified for a project, including a sub-symbolically AI-self managed operating system.
