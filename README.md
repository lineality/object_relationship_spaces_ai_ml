Abstract
A definable way to plan and describe the performance of AI, based on the relationships between types of "objects" that AI will need to deal with. 

Project-specific performance-skills-and-tests for AI are equal to points in a matrix of object-relationship(space)-vectors, which in future can be used with solutions found by AI.

The framework-defined-functions make possible an overall operating system to cover skills specified for a project, including for a sub-symbolically AI-self managed operating system. 

The object relationship space framework can be used to guide project specific system design, to guide discussion, analysis, and reporting, and to make operating systems to manage and enable larger scale AI projects coordinating both many required abilities and many internal and external components.

		Topics:
		- Ethics
		- Learning in General (biological and otherwise)
	Future & Extension:
- Project-Management, Learning,
- & Object-Relationship Spaces
- Planning for future AI project requirements:
	- scale
	- modularity
	- produciton-deployment vs. R&D development
	and the contrast in principle between generalization and 
project-context specific requirements
