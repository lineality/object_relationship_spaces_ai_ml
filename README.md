Evaluate AI with Definable Units of "Intelligence"

Object Relationship Spaces for AI ML: A Framework for 
Clearly Defined, STEM-Compatible, Project-Level, Functional Units of "Intelligence": 
For AI Design, Analysis, Performance, and Operating Systems
G.G.Ashbrook, 2023.03

Abstract
There is a need for the use of well defined performance frameworks to describe the goals and abilities of systems including AI. 

The object-relationship-space framework can be used to guide project-specific design, identifying components, to guide discussion, analysis, testing, and reporting, and possibly to make operating systems to manage and enable smaller or larger scale AI projects coordinating required abilities and internal and external components, including symbolic logistics and sub-symbolic training for AI-self-management. 

Project-specific points in the framework are equal to points in a matrix of object-relationship(space)-vectors, which in future may be used with solutions found and navigated by AI.

Clearly describing a skill that a given AI does not yet have can be a significant part of developing that yet-to-be-attained skill.

Part one concerns a brief overview of the framework.

Part two concerns using the framework and networking AI components.

Part three concerns a discussion of the discussion of AI.

Part four concerns goals, background, and the future.

Appendices include more examples and details.
