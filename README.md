Definable Units of "Intelligence" for Evaluating AI Performance

Object Relationship Spaces for AI-ML: A Framework for 
Clearly Defined, STEM-Compatible, Project-Level, Functional Units of "Intelligence" 
For AI Design, Analysis, Performance, Architecture, and Operating Systems
G.G.Ashbrook, 2023.03/04


Abstract
There is a need for the use of well defined performance frameworks to describe the goals and skills/abilities of systems including AI. 

The overall agenda here is to move toward clearer communication and better definitions, including the pragmatic utilization of universal intersecting/interlocking areas.

This proposed object-relationship-space framework can be used for guiding project-specific system design, goal-setting, discussion, testing, analysis, reporting, regulation, documentation, etc. 
For more detail on what is meant by 'design': to manage and enable smaller or larger scale AI projects coordinating required abilities across internal and external components, including "symbolic" logistics and "sub-symbolic" training (including for AI-self-management), and whole operating-systems for AI. 

AI must be able to handle "objects" in the following interlocking contexts:
1. object-relationship-spaces
2. (internal/external) project-object-database (in a project-framework)
3. project-participants (in a project-framework & participation-space
such that 'objects' are defined as existing outside of the AI in an overall project context, and that so long as the AI effectively deals with these project-objects across these contexts including internal and external handling, it does not matter how the AI 'internally' handles objects. For example, alternative methods of internal handling/processing/management include:
- symbolic vs. sub-symbolic
- single or end-to-end vs. multiple or ensemble or hybrid
- parametric, nonparametric
- explainable vs. black-box
- higher dimensional vs. lower dimensional
- calculation vs. intuitive pattern recognition
- similar-to-h.sapiens, vs. not similar to h.sapiens
etc. 





Interconnecting/Intersecting Areas:
A repeating theme, context, and agenda in this paper is to pragmatically leverage the interconnected functionality of clear definitions, STEM, projects, participation, coordination, system-fitness, positive values, and productivity.

To reiterate and state this as clearly and openly as possible, the context and agenda here is a project, best practice, positive-values, productivity, context. 


Definitions, Frameworks, and Participation
1. Discussion with undefined terms (for example specific abilities) can loop indefinitely regardless of the abilities of AI (at that time or in the case of changes over time in what AI can do). Undefined & under-defined goals, terms, and definitions tell us too little about what is needed, what the system can do, and if the system can do what is needed.

2. Telser Rule Loops: Where "AI" is undefined and every new development is dismissed as "not real AI," the failure to define "AI" tells us too little about what is needed, what the system can do, and if the system can do what is needed.

3. According to an Object-Relationship-Space framework in a project and participation context, AI-ML technology can as of March, 2023 join h.sapiens-humans as a participant in projects, with specific skills/abilities to handle specific project-objects, where projects, participants, and objects in object relations spaces, are clearly and functionally defined in a STEM context. This Object-Relationship-Space framework should define what is needed, what the system can do, and that the system can do what is needed. The details of how the practical context of 'project participation' partially overlaps with the vague context of 'intelligence' are likely significant.


Part one concerns a brief overview of the framework.

Part two concerns using the framework,
e.g. so you can construct your own well defined goals and tests for abilities of AI systems.

Part three concerns a discussion of the discussion of AI,
e.g. so you can critique statements in what you read about AI.

Part four concerns goals and agendas, background concepts and principles,
and future design factors.

Appendices include more examples and details.
